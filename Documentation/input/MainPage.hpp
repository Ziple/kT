 *
 * Welcome to the kT Engine API documentation.
 * Here you'll find all the informations you'll need to develop applications with
 * the kT Engine libraries.
 *
 * <b>But what is the kT engine?</b>
 *
 * The kT engine is a set of libraries and tools intended to build games (2D or 3D)
 * accross several platforms (PC, Gamecube/Wii and DS are currently planned), and build them faster.
 *
 * The API provides access to the inner parts of the engine contrary to the tools which are more "high-level".
 *
 *
 * \section engine_compo_section Composition of the API
 *
 * The API is composed of different modules, here are it:
 * - the Core module: it's the one on which everything else is built.
 *   Thanks to it, all the basics, but necessary, system dependent things are implemented (files, threads, exceptions, and so on)...
 *
 * - the Math module: this module provides a set of -not yet- optimized math related classes such as Vectors, Points, Matrices, Quaternions etc...
 *
 * - the Window module: you will use it to create your windows! Essential.
 *
 * - the Graphics module: this module wraps everything related to graphics (rendering but also scene management)
 *
 * - the Audio module: the same as the graphics module but for audio.
 *
 * - the Network module: dedicated to the network management
 *
 * - the Game module: this is the one you will use the most? It provides somes class to make the development of games easier.
 *
 * To see to the documentation of these modules go to the page Modules .
